## Releases

Each major release contains the source code, the log file captured after a long simulation run, and the resulting plots.

## Reproducing a Simulation

- Install [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- start a simulation: `python RunSim.py`
- once mapping finished, boundary line turns green
